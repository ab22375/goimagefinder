# GoImageFinder Refactoring Completed

## Summary of Changes

The codebase has been refactored to eliminate duplication between the root-level `imageprocessor` package and the `scanner/imageprocessor` package. The changes follow a cleaner architecture with clear separation of concerns:

1. **Centralized Core Functionality**
   - Created `formats.go` in root imageprocessor with common format detection
   - Standardized `ImageLoader` interface in `loaders.go`
   - Consolidated format-specific loaders

2. **Clean Adapter Pattern**
   - Renamed `scanner/imageprocessor` to `scanner/processor`
   - Implemented `processor.go` as a lightweight adapter
   - Removed duplicate format detection code

3. **Dependency Direction**
   - All format detection now flows from root imageprocessor
   - Scanner code depends on core imageprocessor, not vice versa
   - Reduced code duplication significantly

## Benefits

1. **Reduced Duplication**: Eliminated redundant image format detection code
2. **Clearer Architecture**: Better separation between core functionality and scanner-specific code
3. **Easier Maintenance**: Single source of truth for format detection
4. **Simplified Extension**: Adding new formats only requires changes in one place

## Files Modified

- Added:
  - `imageprocessor/formats.go`
  - `imageprocessor/loaders.go`
  - `imageprocessor/standard_loaders.go`
  - `scanner/processor/processor.go`

- Modified:
  - `scanner/scanner.go`
  - `scanner/fileutils.go`
  - `imageprocessor/image_loader_registry.go`

## Further Improvements

1. Add unit tests for the refactored functionality
2. Consider further consolidation of specialized format handlers
3. Enhance error handling and logging in the core imageprocessor package
